# Work Log

## 2025-01-04 - Repository Cleanup & Organization

### GitHub Setup & Push

- Successfully pushed the repository to GitHub using HTTPS with personal access token
- Resolved merge conflicts with remote README
- Set up proper git tracking between local and remote branches

### README Consolidation

- Moved content from duplicate `readme.md` to official `README.md`
- Removed all emojis and cleaned up AI-generated language for professional appearance
- Deleted redundant `readme.md` file

### Major Codebase Cleanup (136MB+ saved)

- **Removed `backend/venv/`** (72MB) - Virtual environment not needed with conda
- **Removed `frontend/node_modules/`** (64MB) - Should not be in version control
- **Removed `backend/__pycache__/`** (20KB) - Python cache files
- **Removed `backend/requirements.txt`** - Redundant with `environment.yml`
- **Removed `backend/package-lock.json`** - Misplaced Node.js file in Python backend
- **Added comprehensive `.gitignore`** - Prevents tracking these files in future

### Configuration File Fix

- **Fixed `config.yaml`** - Was incorrectly containing README content instead of actual YAML configuration
- **Replaced with proper configuration** - API settings, model configs, agent settings, system settings
- **Added `backend/config/config.template.yaml`** - Reference template for customization
- **Kept `environment.yml`** - Essential conda environment specification

### Results

- **Cleaner repository** - 136MB+ smaller, professional structure
- **Proper configuration** - Application now uses actual config instead of defaults
- **Better practices** - Follows version control best practices with proper .gitignore
- **Conda-focused** - Removed conflicting virtual environment setup

Repository is now clean, properly configured, and ready for development.
